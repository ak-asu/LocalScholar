# Quizzer Extension – Design Docs

This folder contains concise documentation to capture requirements, design, and plan for a Chrome MV3 extension that:
- Summarizes pages or selected text
- Generates MCQ/flash cards and displays them as an overlay
- Aggregates content from multiple pages to synthesize a report in the user’s style
- Stores all data locally and exposes selection-aware context menu actions
